Hello Everyone! Welcome to my homepage!

I'm Michael Tong, currently a senior college student in Beihang Univeristy, China. I'm going to move to the U.S. to pursue Ph.D degree, even though I haven't decided which university to attend.

My real name in fact should be "Hao Tong", and I almost forgot I have picked up an English name with "Michael" years ago until one day in Denmark my friends found my name on Facebook was Michael. Michael is a very common name in English, but I chose it for a talented person named **Michael Jordan**.
