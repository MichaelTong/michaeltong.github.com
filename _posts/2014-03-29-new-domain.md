I have bought a domain name!

Now you will find that you can use *michaeltong.github.io*, *www.michael-tong.com* and *michael-tong.com* to get my page.

For Chinese user, we can use <a href="" target="_blank">DNSpod</a> to get free DNS server and we can use <cite>michaeltong.github.io</cite> instead of IP of github to redirect our top-level domain name.

> Besides, pages for my projects will be finished and put on table soon!
