I have bought a domain name!

Now you will find that you can use
 
* **michaeltong.github.io**
* **www.michael-tong.com**
* **michael-tong.com** 

to get access to my page.

For Chinese user, we can use **<a href="https://www.dnspod.cn/" target="_blank">DNSpod</a>** to get free DNS service and we can use domain name of the page (for example, <cite>michaeltong.github.io</cite>) instead of IP of github to redirect our top-level domain name.

Besides, pages for my projects will be finished and put on table soon!
