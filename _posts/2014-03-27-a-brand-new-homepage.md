### A Brand New Homepage

It's really excited to establish this new homepage, and totally personal.

I'm thinking about buying a domain name now so that you can access easily.

The following day I will try to migrate my posts from other sites to this, and will try all means to translate them into English.

Once again, give thanks to **Micheal Rose** who has created this beautiful theme.  
You can visit his github by this link: [Click Here](https://github.com/mmistakes)  
Or his page: [Click Here](http://mademistakes.com/)
