It's really excited to establish this new homepage, and it's free and totally personal.

I'm thinking about buying a domain name now so that you can access easily.

The following days I will try to migrate my posts from other sites to this, and will try all means to translate them into English.

Once again, give thanks to **Micheal Rose** who has created this beautiful theme.  
You can visit his github by this link: <a href="https://github.com/mmistakes" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  
Or his page: <a href="http://mademistakes.com/" target="_blank">Click Here</a>  
Here are two previews of his pages, you can also enter his pages by clicking the pictures.

In addition, you can find many beautiful templates on his github repository.
