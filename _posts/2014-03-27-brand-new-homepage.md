It's really excited to establish this new homepage, and totally personal.

I'm thinking about buying a domain name so that you can access easily.

The following day I will try to migrate my posts from other sites to this, and try all means to translate them into English.

Once again, give thanks to **Micheal Rose** who has created this beautiful theme.
