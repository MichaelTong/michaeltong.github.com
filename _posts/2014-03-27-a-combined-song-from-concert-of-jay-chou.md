Jay Chou(周杰伦) is my favorite male singer, and he has created many records around Asia.  
Don't know how Jay is? Please refer to his page in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Chou" target="_blank">English</a> and <a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%91%A8%E6%9D%B0%E5%80%AB" target="_blank">Chinese</a> on wikipedia.

This video was shot on Jay's concert in 2013 in Taipei. He used 3D reconstruction, holographic projection and maybe some techs doing with voice and image( I remember MRSA is doing research on this) to make <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teresa_Teng" target="_blank">Teresa Teng</a>(<a href="http://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E9%84%A7%E9%BA%97%E5%90%9B" target="_blank">邓丽君</a>) alive and sing songs with Jay.

By the way, Youtube has changed its interface again, feel kinda hard to get used to it... of course, for absence of youtube for so long a time... :(
