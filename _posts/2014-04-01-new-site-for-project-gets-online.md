OSCourseDesign gets online NOW!!!

I have set up the site for OSCourseDesign online.  
Here is a preview for it:  


<figure align="center">
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/OSCourseDesign" target="_blank"><img src="{{ site.url }}/images/postpic/20140401/1.jpg" alt="Preview for project"></a>
	<figcaption><a href="{{ site.url }}/OSCourseDesign" title="Preview for the new site.">Preview for the new site</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>
{: .pull-center} 

You can either click on the picture or use the url <cite><a href="{{ site.url }}/OSCourseDesign" target="_blank">{{ site.url }}/OSCourseDesign</a></cite> to view details.

However, the site is still under construction. When finished, it will provide you with fully detailed design report for each sub-project.

Now, you can get a view of brief introduction on the homepage for the project, and get access to the download links.
